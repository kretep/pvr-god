# pvr-god

Desktop application for managing the processes required for the PVR (person visit registration) tool.

It's a simple application for Windows users. A number of processes are required to run the PVR tool: MongoDB, Restheart, and the PVR-server (which serves the PVR-client, but also proxies to Restheart).
These tools must already be installed, this application is specifically intended to easily (re)start the required processes.
